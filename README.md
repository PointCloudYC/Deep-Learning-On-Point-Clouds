# Deep-Learning-On-Point-Clouds
A curated list of **key papers** on *applying deep learning on point cloud data*. More importantly, I will try to summarize on these papers with a note. Each note will try to summarize the basic background, main proposals, key components of the proposals, achitecture, code implementation, methodology part, potential use of the paper and etc.
